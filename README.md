# Project 3: Dynamic Programming

Submission of our project 3 on "Teleportation in Astro Haunted Galaxies".

## Execution Commands
- Main Script: python3 Project3.py
- Test Script: python3 Project3_test.py OR python3 -m unittest Project3_test.py

## Directions

Project3:
- If your Python is up to date, there should be nothing to be done extra here. "random" and "time" are built in libraries.
- If you intend to run and play around with the values, you can go into the "main" at the bottom and set the passed values to equal whatever numbers you'd like.
    - NOTE: Modifying the values too high -will- affect performance.
- This doesn't run with arguments off the cmd line as the assignment didn't ask for it and honestly it wasn't needed.

Project3_test:
- This is our PyUnit testing file. Make sure that both the algo script and this one are in the same folder before you run it.

Overall:
- Both files each have a description at the top and comments throughout to make understanding the code easier.
- Both have been tested and are confirmed to work when executing.
- We've included any plot screenshots outside of the doc here in case they're hard to read.
